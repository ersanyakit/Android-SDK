# Shufti Pro Verifications

This Shufti Pro SDK document has been compiled to assist developers and technical experts in the integration of Shufti Pro’s API with their mobile-based platforms and applications.

The step-by-step guide has been designed to explain the use of verification services and the technical processes involved in the authentication process. Users are apprised of the different kinds of verification data that is required by the API, as well as the data formats that are required to forward verification data.

Shufti Pro uses a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Human Intelligence technology to provide real-time identity verification services with an accuracy of 99.86%, in the fastest response time possible. 
 

## Verification Options 
The Rest API functions at the backbone of Shufti Pro SDK offer technical assistance for smooth mobile-based verifications. All the features and data points of the API work efficiently with SDK integration, providing a seamless user experience. 

Shufti Pro’s Rest API and SDK both operate with a JSON object defining data keys for its verification requests. You can either use SDK or Rest API, as both work perfectly for mobile integration. In case you opt for Rest API, less code will have to be written to complete the integration process. 

Shufti Pro allows for both OCR based as well non-OCR Verifications. These are performed with assistance from the native camera of the end user's device. The quality of images/video received for verification, therefore, heavily relies on the resolution prowess of the devices’ camera.


* ### With OCR
During OCR Verification, an end-user simply provides identity documents to Shufti Pro for authentication. The automated Shufti Pro API extracts credentials from the provided documents and verifies them as part of a single identity process.

* ### Without OCR
During verification without OCR, Shufti Pro customers or end-user is required to provide not only verification data but also provide proof of that data as well in the form of identity documents. 
Additional Shufti Pro [resources](verification-without-ocr) can better guide better in understanding the technical requirements of Verification without OCR.

* ### With Rest Api
If you opt for mobile verification with Shufti Pro’s Rest API, a web-view built upon HTML 5 will be displayed to the end user. All data points and fields are adequately defined in the Rest API. The format for sending verification data will be a JSON object, similar to other mobile verification formats (OCR and Non-OCR).
